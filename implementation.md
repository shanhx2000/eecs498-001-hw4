   c. Discussion about the performance

   From the results above, we can observed that both methods can fit with a satisfying model. 

   In my case the time for the two algorithms are quite different. The time for RANSAC is far larger than that of PCA. In general, RANSAC needs at least one fit for the inliers, which cost the time similar to PCA. Moreover, the RANSAC method depends on the iteration set. In my case, the max iteration is set to 100. A smaller iteration can improve speed but reduce stability. 

   For the error, the PCA method has an increasing trend while the trend for RANSAC is not clear. This indicates that, when the amount of outliers is large, the RANSAC might give a better performance. However, the RANSAC is a random method and depends on the max iteration, it is not guaranteed to be better than PCA.

   Given the results, target 3 is more difficult to fit. One reason is that the target is a scaled version of the source, which isn't considered in our R, t transformation. The target 0 seems to be second difficult one and one probable reason is that the ICP method fails into a local minimum since the points are distributed in layers and we have fit the most layers except the uppermost and lowest ones.
